# Chemical engineering calculations

By the fact that I think that chemical engineering is way more than just repetitive calculus in my calculator, I decided to code some scripts to help me doing what really matters - **think**. 

Here are some calculations that I've already coded

## Flash vaporization

### REMEMBER!
> xi => composition of liquid flow rate 

> yi => composition of vaporized flow rate

1. Operation conditions - Boiling and Dew temperatures - knowing operation pressure

2. Flow rate and compositions knowing 
- Operation conditions (Pressure and Temperature);
- Feed composition
- assuming a feed flow rate as calculation basis (100)
